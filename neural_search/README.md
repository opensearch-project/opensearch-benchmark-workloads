## AI Search Workload

This workload is to benchmark performance of indexing and search for different search methods (Semantic, Hybrid, Sparse and multimodal). Check this [link](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/vector-search/ai-search/index/) for more information about AI search. 
### Dataset

The Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset, released by Quora, is a collection of over 400,000 question pairs, each labeled to indicate whether the two questions are paraphrases of each other, used for research in natural language processing and machine learning.

- Dataset: https://public.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/thakur/BEIR/datasets/quora.zip

### Example document and query for Quora dataset
```json
{
    "_id": "22",
    "title": "",
    "text": "What are some of the things technicians can tell about the durability and reliability of Laptops and its components?",
    "metadata":  {
    }
}


```
```json
"query": {
     "neural_sparse": {
       "passage_embedding": {
         "query_text": "What are some of the best science projects?",
         "model_id": ""
       }
     }
   }
```
### Running a benchmark
Before running a benchmark, ensure that the load generation host is able to access your cluster endpoint, which can be verified by a `curl $ENDPOINT` command.

By default, we use pretrained models for the workload, so steps to train the model being used are not required. Currently, we support 3 test procedures for the AI search workload, the default procedure is named sparse-search. This test procedures will index a data set of vectors into an OpenSearch cluster and then run a set of queries against the generated index.

Due to the number of parameters this workload offers, it's recommended to create a parameter file that specifies the desired workload parameters instead of listing them all on the OSB command line. An example parameter file `sparse_search.json` is provided in the `params` directory within this workload.

To run the workload, invoke the following command with the params file.
```
# OpenSearch Cluster End point url with hostname and port
export ENDPOINT= https://search.example.com
# Absolute file path of Workload param file
export PARAMS_FILE=/path/to/params.json

opensearch-benchmark execute-test \
    --target-hosts $ENDPOINT \
    --workload neural_search \
    --workload-params ${PARAMS_FILE} \
    --pipeline benchmark-only \
    --test-procedure=sparse-search \
    --kill-running-processes
    
```
### Procedures

#### sparse-search, hybrid-search, semantic-search

These test procedures carry out the following steps:
 - Delete the current index and model
 - Ingests the data corpus with vector embedding
 - Runs a force-merge
 - Performs the sparse search

### Specifying Workload Parameters

Example:
```json
{
  "passage_embedding_type": "rank_features",
  "index_name": "quora",
  "index_body": "indices/quora.json",
  "corpora_name": "quora",
  "ingest_percentage": 100,
  "variable_queries": 0,
  "warmup_time_period": 5,
  "default_ingest_pipeline": "nlp-default-ingest-pipeline-sparse"
}
 ```

This is already setup as `sparse_search.json` in params directory, provide it to OpenSearch Benchmark with `--workload-params="/path/to/sparse_search.json"`. If only one or two parameters need to be specified, rather than using a parameter file, they can be specified on the command line like so: --workload-params=search_clients:2.
We also provide necessary parameters for Semantic and Hybrid search, check `semantic_search.json` and `hybrid_search.json` in params directory

### Gotchas
1. The above benchmark is running against a cluster that has two data nodes (See Docker compose [detail](https://docs.opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/install-opensearch/docker/#sample-docker-composeyml)). 
If your cluster only have one data node, test procedures may stuck in `check-cluster-health` step, in that case, you should add a `number_of_replicas` parameter with value `0`
