## AI Search Workload

This workload is to benchmark performance of indexing and search for different search methods (Semantic, Hybrid, Sparse and multimodal). Check this [link](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/vector-search/ai-search/index/) for more information about AI search. 
### Dataset

The Quora Question Pairs (QQP) dataset, released by Quora, is a collection of over 400,000 question pairs, each labeled to indicate whether the two questions are paraphrases of each other, used for research in natural language processing and machine learning.
- Quora website: https://www.quora.com/q/quoradata/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs
- Dataset: https://public.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/thakur/BEIR/datasets/quora.zip
- This dataset is used for benchmarking Semantic, Hybrid and Sparse search methods

Amazon Berkeley Objects (ABO) dataset, owned by Amazon, is an open-licensed dataset of Amazon products with metadata, catalog images, and artist-created 3D models. ABO is a collection of 147,702 product listings with multilingual metadata and 398,212 unique catalog images
- ABO website: https://amazon-berkeley-objects.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
- Dataset small image: https://amazon-berkeley-objects.s3.amazonaws.com/archives/abo-images-small.tar
- Dataset description: https://amazon-berkeley-objects.s3.amazonaws.com/archives/abo-listings.tar
- This dataset is used for benchmarking Multimodal search method

### Additional Note for Multimodal search benchmark

1. Currently, there's no [pretrained model](https://docs.opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/pretrained-models/) available for multimodal search, hence we will be using remote models
2. This benchmark requires OpenSearch version 2.16 or higher, as the built-in function for creating connectors was only introduced in that version
3. We pre-processed the ABO dataset by converting actual images (small ones) into base 64 encoding binaries, as the search method only accepts image binary as input
4. By default, we utilize [Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings G1 model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/titan-multiemb-models.html) hosted on Bedrock to perform the benchmark, which requires create remote connector, register remote model and the following cluster setting:
   1. `"plugins.ml_commons.trusted_connector_endpoints_regex": ["^https://bedrock-runtime\\..*[a-z0-9-]\\.amazonaws\\.com/.*$"]`
5. If you want to use other remote models that are hosted on other platforms such as cohere, you will need to update the cluster setting by adding trusted endpoints and adjust the logic to create connectors, check this [link](https://docs.opensearch.org/docs/latest/ml-commons-plugin/remote-models/index/) for more details
6. This workload uses the Amazon Bedrock model by default. This model requires the following:
   1. Have a valid AWS account
   2. Have proper access permissions for the model (which can be obtained through this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html))
   3. Generate AWS credentials and pass them as workload parameters, we will use the credentials to connect to the remote model

### Example document and query for Quora dataset
```json
{
    "_id": "22",
    "title": "",
    "text": "What are some of the things technicians can tell about the durability and reliability of Laptops and its components?",
    "metadata":  {
    }
}


```
```json
"query": {
     "neural_sparse": {
       "passage_embedding": {
         "query_text": "What are some of the best science projects?",
         "model_id": ""
       }
     }
   }
```

### Example document and query for ABO dataset
```json
{
    "_id": 1,
    "main_image_id": "71dZhpsferL",
    "image_description": "Amazon Brand - Solimo Designer Couples Sitting at Dark 3D Printed Hard Back Case Mobile Cover for Lenovo K4 Note",
    "image_binary": "<base_64_binary>",

          "model_id": "",
          "k": {{query_k | default(10)}}
        }
      }
    }
```

### Running a benchmark
Before running a benchmark, ensure that the load generation host is able to access your cluster endpoint, which can be verified by a `curl $ENDPOINT` command.

By default, we use pretrained models for the workload, so steps to train the model being used are not required. Currently, we support 3 test procedures for the AI search workload, the default procedure is named sparse-search. This test procedures will index a data set of vectors into an OpenSearch cluster and then run a set of queries against the generated index.

Due to the number of parameters this workload offers, it's recommended to create a parameter file that specifies the desired workload parameters instead of listing them all on the OSB command line. An example parameter file `sparse_search.json` is provided in the `params` directory within this workload.

To run the workload, invoke the following command with the params file.
```
# OpenSearch Cluster End point url with hostname and port
export ENDPOINT= https://search.example.com
# Absolute file path of Workload param file
export PARAMS_FILE=/path/to/params.json

opensearch-benchmark execute-test \
    --target-hosts $ENDPOINT \
    --workload neural_search \
    --workload-params ${PARAMS_FILE} \
    --pipeline benchmark-only \
    --test-procedure=sparse-search \
    --kill-running-processes
    
```
### Procedures

#### sparse-search, hybrid-search, semantic-search

These test procedures carry out the following steps:
 - Delete the current index and model
 - Ingests the data corpus with vector embedding
 - Runs a force-merge
 - Performs the sparse search

### Specifying Workload Parameters

Example:
```json
{
  "passage_embedding_type": "rank_features",
  "index_name": "quora",
  "index_body": "indices/quora.json",
  "corpora_name": "quora",
  "ingest_percentage": 100,
  "variable_queries": 0,
  "warmup_time_period": 5,
  "default_ingest_pipeline": "nlp-default-ingest-pipeline-sparse"
}
 ```

This is already setup as `sparse_search.json` in params directory, provide it to OpenSearch Benchmark with `--workload-params="/path/to/sparse_search.json"`. If only one or two parameters need to be specified, rather than using a parameter file, they can be specified on the command line like so: --workload-params=search_clients:2.
We also provide necessary parameters for Semantic and Hybrid search, check `semantic_search.json` and `hybrid_search.json` in params directory

### Gotchas
1. The above benchmark is running against a cluster that has two data nodes (See Docker compose [detail](https://docs.opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/install-opensearch/docker/#sample-docker-composeyml)). 
If your cluster only has a single data node, test procedures may get stuck in the `check-cluster-health` step. In that case, you should add a `number_of_replicas` parameter with value `0`
2. For Multimodal test procedure, the performance also depend on the Bedrock model. Most common issue is requests are throttled by Bedrock, we can either request a service quota increase (check this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/quotas.html) for details),
or adjust the target-throughput (not ideal, as it makes the result look bad)
