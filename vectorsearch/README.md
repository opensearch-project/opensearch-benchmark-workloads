# Vector Search Workload

This workload is to benchmark performance of indexing and search of Vector Engine of OpenSearch.

## Datasets

This workload currently supports datasets  with either HDF5 format or Big-ANN.
You can download datasets from [here](http://corpus-texmex.irisa.fr/) to benchmark the quality of approximate k-NN algorithm from
OpenSearch.

### Running a benchmark

Before running a benchmark, ensure that the load generation host is able to access your cluster endpoint and that the 
appropriate dataset is available on the host.

Currently, we support 4 test procedures for the vector search workload. The default procedure is named no-train-test and does not include the steps required to train the model being used.
This test procedures will index a data set of vectors into an OpenSearch cluster and then run a set of queries against the generated index. 

Due to the number of parameters this workload offers, it's recommended to create a parameter file that specifies the desired workload 
parameters instead of listing them all on the OSB command line. Users are welcome to use the example param files,
`faiss-sift-128-l2.json`, `nmslib-sift-128-l2.json`, or `lucene-sift-128-l2.json` in `/params`, as references. Here, we named
the parameter file using a format `<Vector Engine Type>-<Dataset Name>-<No of Dimension>-<Space Type>.json`

To run the workload, invoke the following command with the params file.

```
# OpenSearch Cluster End point url with hostname and port
export ENDPOINT=  
# Absolute file path of Workload param file
export PARAMS_FILE=

opensearch-benchmark execute-test \
    --target-hosts $ENDPOINT \
    --workload vectorsearch \
    --workload-params ${PARAMS_FILE} \
    --pipeline benchmark-only \
    --kill-running-processes
```

## Current Procedures

### No Train Test

The No Train Test procedure is used to test vector search indices which requires no training.
You can define the underlying configuration of the vector search algorithm like specific engine, space type, etc... as
method definition . Check [vector search method definitions]([https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/knn/knn-index/#method-definitions)
for more details.

### No Train Test Index Only
This procedure is used to index only vector search index which requires no training. This will be useful if
you are interested in benchmarking only indexing operation.

### Force Merge Index
This procedure is used to optimize vector search indices by performing force merge on an index, up to given maximum segments.
For a large dataset, force merge is a costly operation. Hence, it is better to have separate procedure to trigger
force merge occasionally based on user's requirement.

### Search
This procedure is used to benchmark previously indexed vector search index. This will be useful if you want
to benchmark large vector search index without indexing everytime since load time is substantial for a large dataset.
This also contains warmup operation to avoid cold start problem during vector search.

### No Train Test AOSS

This is similar to no train test, except, targeted for Amazon OpenSearch Serverless Vector Search Collection. This procedure
does not contain operations like refresh and warm up since they are not supported by Vector Search Collection.
